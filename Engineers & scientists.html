    <p><h1> Engineers & scientists </h1><p>
    <p><big> Engineers would be nowhere without science, and science would be nowhere without engineering — because engineers put into motion what science has discovered. 
    National Medal of Science winner Theodore von Kármán said, “Scientists discover the world that exists; 
    engineers create the world that never was.” They’re both important.

“Engineer” is a verb, which means that it’s action-oriented. 
It’s a key way we look at life. Engineers consider themselves problem solvers and also creators.
 We create products, processes, and systems that address economic and societal needs — like the ability to telework. 
 Engineers are used to thinking in systems; a pandemic is a system, for example, and society is a system.
