        <p><h1>Engineering can help the Workforce</h1></p>
        <p><big>Every time there’s a crisis or a major problem, there are opportunities that lead to improvements.
         For example, there will be more people with ideas about how to distribute things — leading to more Amazon-like companies. 
         There will be innovations in rapid diagnostics; the Holy Grail is a home test for COVID-19. 
         There will be new platforms — I don’t think Zoom is the end; there will be competitors. These will all produce jobs.
          We’re also learning more about education, so you’ll see more companies emerging around home schooling and education.       

Much of the economy will come back in information technology and manufacturing — and then in the service industry, 
because you’ll need to service all of these things. I actually think COVID will lead to more economic development once we control it,
The speed and scale of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have improved greatly, and engineers have brought artificial intelligence, automation, and process control to industry’s development of those diagnostics. 
The increase in testing capability is due in great measure to these engineering tools. One important element engineering brings is risk modeling. For example, suppose you’re relying on a certain precursor chemical to make a therapeutic, and there’s a hurricane between you and the source. 
Do you have a secondary source? Or what happens if you’re making drugs or vaccines, and there’s a three-day moratorium on shipping, or an airport is closed? You have to be able to adjust.

To help do this, some companies are using what’s called a “digital twin” — a computer model of the real world that can help them adjust to the real world. They model systems in the real world — such as the pandemic, or manufacturing processes — which lets them anticipate problems and plan what to do.  
The model is continually improved by putting in more real-world data as it emerges.
